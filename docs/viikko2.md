The virtualbox and programming environment are all set up, they work great and I have started to program the robot. This week, I have mainly worked on learning how the lejos api works. I have improved the first robot design and the sensors have permanent (I think) positions now. 

Programming-wise, the parking part is about half-way complete. When I run it on the robot, it is rather inconsistent though so I will work on fixing that this week and then start working on the navigation system as soon as possible. 

Build-wise, it is a very simple three-wheel robot; no problem. I think that I might need an extra ultrasonic sensor though and I wonder when it will be possible to get one. But so far, managing with one is not an issue. Bluetooth doesn't work at all but I have a cable.

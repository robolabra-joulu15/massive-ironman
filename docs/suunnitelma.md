**Plan**
 
  My main plan to make a small self-driving robot that can navigate a little "town" that I will make with cardboard boxes and so on. There will be a about 3 rows of streets with 2/3 houses on each one. At the end you should be able to tell the robot which house to go and it knows it current relative position, navigates to the new address and parks in front of the building.
  That is the main idea. However it might be too much to do so I will start from by working on the robot doing an unassisted parking sequence next to a building. Then I will work on it going to houses on the same street and then on to different streets and so on. At the very worst case scenario I will have a robot that parks but my aim is a robot that navigates the entire town efficiently.
  
**Materials**

  I have in my kit a compass sensor that I will use a lot for the navigation. I also will use the ultrasonic and touch sensors for object avoidance especially during parking and the light sensor to read some navigation pointers from the road surface if necessary. 
  
**Problems**

  Based on past experience with the mindstorms, I think most problems will come from having the robots make exact angle turns without using line-following which is crucial in this project. However I have never tried this compass sensor and it should help. I might also have problems with the algorithm when I actually start working on the code.
